# CMSE 822: Parallel Computing Final Project

This will serve as the repo for your final project for the course. Complete all code development work in this repo. Commit early and often! For a detailed description of the project requirements, see [here](https://cmse822.github.io/projects).

First, give a brief description of your project topic idea and detail how you will address each of the specific project requierements given in the link above. 

I would really like to do a very simple and primitive turbulence simulation (using Navier Stokes, not MHD) with a very simple and primitive finite difference method, but I'm worried this is too involved. I would like to show the dependency of turbulence behavior as it relates to grid size (I don't think I will be able to implement different orders of solvers because that can become really involved).

If that doesn't work, I'm happy to do an MD implementation, but I'm not sure what simulations I would compare to...
